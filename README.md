    <b>Simple but stylish LaTeX CV template for professionals.</b>
</p>

## Purpose of Simple-CV
This template was heavily inspired by [AwesomeCV](https://https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV/tree/master) with some stylistic inspiration from [RenderCV sb2nov](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/rendercv-sb2nov-theme/gdspgtsnfncm). The main difference is that this CV template tries to signifiantly reduce complexity of the underlying class, improve on readability of entry elements, while preserving a simple yet beautiful style of the CV.

## How to Use
Full installation of TeX is assumed. On Ubuntu, install using `sudo apt install texlive-full`. Intented for `pdfLaTeX` compiler.
